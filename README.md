iNews - News Aggregator
=======================

iNews is news aggregator, which i wrote as part of my Master Thesis.
Currently it's an interface prototype and there is not much analysis done on the backend.

The data is coming from the newscred.com API, using the test-key.
In future releases articles will be fetched from a variety of different sources and will be analyzed, based on pro/con and opinion strength.
